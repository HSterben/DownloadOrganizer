# DownloadOrganizer
A Java-based FileWatcher utility that monitors a specific directory (Downloads) for new files. Once a new file is detected, the utility checks for its readiness, and depending on the file type or name, moves it to a designated subdirectory. It handles temporary download files (.tmp, .opdownload) and can rename files based on specific criteria.
